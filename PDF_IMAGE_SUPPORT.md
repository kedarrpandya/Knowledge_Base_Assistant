# PDF & Image Support - Now Added! 📄🖼️

## New Feature: Upload PDFs and Images

Your Knowledge Assistant can now read and understand:
- **PDF documents** (`.pdf`)
- **Images with text** (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`)

## How It Works

### PDF Extraction
- Uses `pdf-parse` library
- Extracts all text from PDFs automatically
- Preserves text formatting and structure
- Fast extraction (typically < 2 seconds)

### Image OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Uses `tesseract.js` for OCR
- Reads text from images automatically
- Supports multiple image formats
- Works with screenshots, scanned documents, photos, etc.
- Processing time: 3-10 seconds depending on image size

## Supported File Types

| Type | Extensions | Processing Method |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Text | `.txt` | Direct read |
| Markdown | `.md` | Direct read |
| JSON | `.json` | Parsed and formatted |
| PDF | `.pdf` | Text extraction |
| Images | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp` | OCR (Optical Character Recognition) |

## How to Use

## Best Practices for Images

### For Best OCR Results:
✅ **DO:**
- Use high-resolution images (at least 300 DPI)
- Ensure good contrast between text and background
- Keep text horizontal (not tilted)
- Use clear, readable fonts
- Ensure good lighting (for photos)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use blurry or low-quality images
- Upload images with very small text
- Use handwritten text (OCR works best with printed text)
- Upload images with heavy backgrounds/patterns

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used:
- **pdf-parse v1.1.1**: Fast PDF text extraction
- **tesseract.js v5.0.4**: JavaScript OCR engine

### Performance:
- **PDF**: ~1-3 seconds for typical documents
- **Images**: ~3-10 seconds depending on:
  - Image size
  - Text complexity
  - Image quality

### Limitations:
- Maximum file size: 10MB (configurable)
- OCR works best with printed text (not handwriting)
- Very low-quality images may not extract well
- Serverless functions have 10-second timeout (Vercel)

## Error Handling

If upload fails, you'll see specific error messages:

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Insufficient content extracted" | File has no readable text | Ensure file contains text |
| "Failed to extract text" | Processing error | Try re-uploading or different format |
| "Unsupported file type" | Wrong file extension | Use supported formats only |
| "Document content too large" | File exceeds limit | Compress or split the document |

## Use Cases

### 1. Company Knowledge Base
Upload all company PDFs:
- Employee handbooks
- Policy documents
- Training materials
- Standard operating procedures

### 2. Research & Documentation
Upload research papers and documents:
- Academic PDFs
- Research papers
- Technical documentation
- Whitepapers

### 3. Meeting Notes & Screenshots
Upload visual content:
- Screenshot of whiteboard sessions
- Meeting notes (images)
- Presentation slides (exported as images)
- Scanned documents

### 4. Legal & Contracts
Upload legal documents:
- Contracts (PDFs)
- Legal agreements
- Compliance documents
- Signed documents (scanned)

## Next Steps

After uploading your documents, you can:
1. **Search instantly**: Ask questions about uploaded content
2. **Verify**: List all documents via the UI
3. **Delete**: Remove documents if needed
4. **Categorize**: Organize by tags and categories

## Tips for Maximum Accuracy

### For PDFs:
- Ensure PDFs are text-based (not scanned images)
- For scanned PDFs, convert to images first for OCR

### For Images:
- Take clear, well-lit photos
- Use scanning apps for better quality
- Crop to relevant text area before uploading
- Ensure text is readable to human eye

## Free Deployment

Both PDF and OCR work perfectly on free tiers:
- ✅ Vercel (serverless functions)
- ✅ Render.com (web service)
- ✅ Local development

**No additional costs!** All processing happens server-side.

## Troubleshooting

### "OCR taking too long"
- Reduce image size/resolution
- Crop to text area only
- Try converting to a simpler format

### "PDF extraction failed"
- Ensure PDF is not password-protected
- Check if PDF is text-based (not scanned)
- Try re-exporting PDF from source

### "Image text not recognized"
- Improve image quality
- Increase contrast
- Ensure text is horizontal
- Use higher resolution

## What's Next?

Future enhancements planned:
- 📊 Excel/CSV support
- 📝 Word document support (.docx)
- 🌍 Multi-language OCR
- 📐 Table extraction from PDFs
- 🖼️ Diagram/chart understanding
