# 📋 Project Reorganization Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

Your Knowledge Assistant project has been reorganized into **two clear deployment modes** with all files properly separated.

## 🚀 How to Run Each Mode

### 🏠 **Local Mode (FREE)**

**One-command setup:**
```bash
./local/quick-start.sh
```

**Manual steps:**
```bash
# 1. Start Docker services
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# 2. Start backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
npx ts-node ../local/backend/index-local.ts

# 3. Start frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:5173
```

**Stop everything:**
```bash
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.local.yml down
```

---

### 🏢 **Enterprise Mode (Azure)**

```bash
# 1. Deploy Azure infrastructure
cd enterprise/infrastructure
terraform apply

# 2. Start backend (local dev)
cd backend
npm start

# 3. Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# 4. Deploy to Azure
npm run deploy:azure
```

## 📂 What Files Are Where

### Local Files (in `local/` folder)

| File | Purpose | How to Use |
|------|---------|------------|
| `backend/index-local.ts` | Local server | `npx ts-node ../local/backend/index-local.ts` |
| `backend/groqRagService.ts` | Groq integration | Auto-loaded by index-local.ts |
| `backend/localRagService.ts` | Qdrant + Ollama | Auto-loaded by index-local.ts |
| `scripts/load-local-data.ts` | Load sample data | `npx ts-node local/scripts/load-local-data.ts` |
| `docker-compose.local.yml` | Docker services | `docker compose -f local/docker-compose.local.yml up -d` |
| `quick-start.sh` | Automated setup | `./local/quick-start.sh` |
| `README.md` | Local docs | Read it! |

### Enterprise Files (in `enterprise/` folder)

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `backend/` | Azure-specific configurations |
| `infrastructure/` | Terraform, ARM, Bicep templates |
| `power-platform/` | Power Apps, Automate, Virtual Agents |

### Shared Files

| Folder | Purpose | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `frontend/` | React UI | Both modes |
| `backend/` | Core business logic | Both modes |

---

## 🎯 Key Documents

| Document | Purpose | When to Read |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **START.md** | Quick overview | First! |
| **README.md** | Full project info | For understanding |
| **RUN_LOCAL.md** | Local setup | When running locally |
| **RUN_ENTERPRISE.md** | Azure setup | When deploying to Azure |
| **STRUCTURE.md** | Detailed structure | For deep dive |
| **local/README.md** | Local dev guide | Local development |
| **local/INTERACTIVE_FEATURES.md** | UI features | Understanding the UI |

---

## ✨ What Stayed the Same

- Frontend code (all UI components)
- Backend core business logic
- Package dependencies
- Environment variables (.env.local, .env)
- Data models and types

**Nothing broke!** Both modes still work exactly as before.

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Old Way
```bash
./quick-start.sh                              # Was in root
cd backend && npx ts-node src/index-local.ts  # Cluttered with enterprise
docker-compose.local.yml                       # In root
```

### New Way
```bash
./local/quick-start.sh                        # Organized in local/
cd backend && npx ts-node ../local/backend/index-local.ts  # Clear separation
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.local.yml up -d     # Explicit path
```

## 💡 Benefits of New Structure

### ✅ Clear Separation
- Local files in `local/`
- Enterprise files in `enterprise/`
- Shared code stays in root

### ✅ Easy to Understand
- Each mode has its own folder
- Clear documentation for each
- No confusion about what file does what

### ✅ Maintenance
- Update local without touching enterprise
- Update enterprise without touching local
- Shared code benefits both

### ✅ Collaboration
- Team members know where to look
- New developers onboard faster
- Less "where is that file?" questions
