# üéÆ Interactive Features Guide

Your Knowledge Assistant now has **fully interactive** and **physics-based** elements!

## ‚≠ê Star Constellation Background

### Features:
- **400 animated stars** forming rich constellation patterns (increased from 150)
- **Enhanced constellation lines** with better visibility (35% opacity)
- **Physics-based mouse attraction** - stars follow your cursor with realistic forces
- **Brighter stars** (20% size, 90% opacity) for better visibility
- **Mouse trail effect** - 30-point 3D trail following your cursor
- **Real-time rendering** with smooth 60 FPS animation

### Interaction:
- Move your mouse across the screen to see stars attracted with realistic physics
- Constellations dynamically form and break based on proximity
- Dense network creates more intricate, beautiful patterns

## üé® Interactive 3D Torus Knot (Mobius Strip)

### Features:
- **Large prominent torus knot** - 5 units radius, beautifully visible
- **Positioned optimally** - closer and bigger for maximum visual impact
- **Wireframe design** with white color scheme
- **Real-time mouse tracking** - follows cursor smoothly
- **Dynamic scaling** on hover (15% size increase)
- **Enhanced lighting** - multiple point lights and spotlights

### Interactions:
1. **Mouse Following**: 
   - Torus knot smoothly follows your cursor with damped physics
   - Maintains elegant rotation while tracking
   - Interpolated movement for smooth experience

2. **Hover Effects**:
   - Scales up 15% when hovered
   - Emissive intensity increases from 30% to 60%
   - Visual feedback for interaction

3. **Continuous Rotation**:
   - Elegant rotation on X and Y axes
   - Auto-orbiting camera for dynamic viewing
   - Smooth 60 FPS animation

## üí´ Interactive Network Particles

### Features:
- **80 animated particles** with white/smoke colors
- **Dynamic network connections** (constellation-style)
- **Particle attraction** to mouse cursor
- **Glow effects** near cursor

### Interactions:
1. **Mouse Movement**:
   - Particles within 150px are attracted to cursor
   - Smooth acceleration towards mouse
   - Friction-based slowdown

2. **Glow Effects**:
   - Particles near cursor glow brighter
   - Radial gradient glow effect
   - Intensity based on distance

3. **Network Lines**:
   - Lines connect nearby particles
   - Smoke-colored connections (rgba(229, 231, 235))
   - Dynamic opacity based on distance

4. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Cursor changes to crosshair
   - Particles brighten when mouse is near
   - Smooth trail effect

## üé® Color Scheme

All elements use a sophisticated **smoke & white** palette:

```
Background:       #000000 (Pure Black)
Particles:        #FFFFFF (White, 60-100% opacity)
Network Lines:    #E5E7EB (Smoke Gray, variable opacity)
Stars:            #FFFFFF (White, 90% opacity, 0.2 size)
Constellation:    #E5E7EB (Smoke Gray, 35% opacity)
Torus Knot:       #FFFFFF (White wireframe, 50-80% opacity)
Glow:             White with variable emissive intensity
```

- **Fade effect** as trail extends
- **Real-time updates** at 60 FPS

### How it Works:
- Tracks last 30 cursor positions
- Renders smooth line connecting points
- Automatically fades older points
- Transparent white color
