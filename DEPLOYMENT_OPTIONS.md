## 🥈 Runner-Up: Fly.io

Great if you want more control and like Docker.

### ✅ Pros
- More powerful free tier (3 VMs)
- Global edge network
- SSH access
- Great CLI

### ❌ Cons
- Requires Dockerfile
- CLI setup needed
- More configuration

See **[FLY_DEPLOY.md](./FLY_DEPLOY.md)** for full guide.

## 🥉 Third Place: Vercel Serverless

Good if you want frontend + backend on same platform.

### ✅ Pros
- Same platform as frontend
- 100% free
- No CORS issues
- Auto-scales

### ❌ Cons
- 10-second timeout limit
- Requires refactoring to API routes
- Stateless (no problem for us)

See **[VERCEL_BACKEND_DEPLOY.md](./VERCEL_BACKEND_DEPLOY.md)** for full guide.

## 🚫 Avoid: Render.com

Render is good but has issues with this project.

### ❌ Why Skip?
- Slow build times (5-10 minutes)
- Complex path resolution issues
- Frequent cold starts on free tier
- TypeScript compilation issues

See **[render.yaml](./render.yaml)** if you still want to try.

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### For You (Best Overall)

**Use Railway.app** 

It's the perfect balance of:
- Simplicity (5-minute setup)
- Reliability (no cold starts)
- Free tier (enough for this project)
- Developer experience (great dashboard)

### Alternative Strategy

If you want to minimize services:

**Use Vercel for BOTH frontend + backend**
- Everything in one place
- Single URL
- No CORS
- Still 100% free

I can set this up for you if you prefer!
